# Lucciefr - Lua code caving, injection and exploration framework

This is the "developer" reference documentation, auto-generated from
source (see [Github repo](https://github.com/castle-anthrax/Lucciefr))
using doxygen. It has details on many of Lucciefr's internals.

If you're interested in a 'broader' picture, you might want to check out
the documentation overview or the (luadoc) "user" documentation.
